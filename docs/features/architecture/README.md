## Core Architecture

### Player-Transcript Synchronization
📄 [`player-transcript-sync.md`](./player-transcript-sync.md) ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**

Critical documentation for understanding how the WaveformPlayer and TranscriptEditor synchronize:

- State flow between components
- Seek operation types and their implementations
- Why `seekToTime` uses both `setCurrentTime` AND `requestSeek`
- The selection sync effect and why it works
- Common pitfalls that cause navigation bugs
- Performance considerations
- Testing strategy

**Read this before making any changes to seek or selection logic!**
