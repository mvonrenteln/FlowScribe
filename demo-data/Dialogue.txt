Alright, here’s a **clean, polished in-character transcript** in English: natural spoken tone, believable table-talk style, no OOC chatter, no rules-talk, but still long enough to feel like a real session log and closely aligned to the story beats and important passages.
It keeps the flow, the humor, the tension, and the escalating mystery.

## **Transcript (Clean Narrative Dialogue)**

**SL:** The mountains stand ahead of you, quiet and ominous. The strange ley-line still hums nearby—wrong, hollow, like something missing where power should be.

**Durrandir:** We shouldn’t stay. The land is wounded, and whatever caused it is still out there. The mountains will not wait for us.

**Oswin:** I agree. Whatever twisted this ley-line is still active. I want to see where it leads… preferably without dying.

**Glymbar:** Mountains, monsters, maybe treasure. Works for me.

**Sherkan:** As long as something tries to kill us, I’m happy.

### **Returning to the Village Leader**

**Durrandir:** (removing his mask respectfully) We’re leaving. We chase the threat instead of waiting for it to return here. There was talk of a bridge. Is it still intact?

**Tsa Priestess:** Yes. You can cross safely. And yes… we feel it too. The air is wrong now. Since the tree fell, everything has changed.

**Durrandir:** Then it began the day everything broke.

**Tsa Priestess:** I believe so. And I believe you’re the ones meant to face it.

**Durrandir:** Then we’ll do what we can. Protect your people. Guard the new sapling. And pray your enemy does not come before we return.

**Tsa Priestess:** May the gods walk beside you.

---

### **Leaving the Village**

**Durrandir:** There’s a bridge. No more excuses.

**Oswin:** Good. The curiosity is killing me faster than the danger.

**Glymbar:** Still unholy, this movement spell of yours. Useful… but unholy.

**Sherkan:** Don’t complain. You can swing your axe longer.

**Glymbar:** That’s what scares me.

---

### **Crossing Toward the Mountains**

**SL:** The bridge stands untouched, stone strong beneath your feet though its railings are shattered. The river snarls below, but the path forward is clear.

**Oswin:** The ley-line doesn’t follow the bridge. It runs beside it. Straight. Uncaring. Wrong.

**Durrandir:** So we follow the wrongness.

**Sherkan:** That’s been our specialty lately.

---

### **The First Signs of Corruption**

**SL:** After some travel, the nature near the ley-line shifts. Grass grows in warped shapes. Bushes twist. Branches bend like broken fingers reaching for something that isn’t there.

**Durrandir:** This isn’t random. The world doesn’t grow like this.

**Oswin:** That’s… not just decay. That’s intent.

**Durrandir:** Could it be writing?

**Oswin:** …Let me look.

---

### **Oswin Examines the “Script”**

**Oswin:** It looks like Zhayad. But it isn’t. It pretends to be. It’s like someone who knows how letters should look but has never actually learned to write.

**Durrandir:** Meaning?

**Oswin:** Meaning this is imitation. Corruption trying to masquerade as logic. And everything it says comes down to one idea: merging things that were never meant to be merged.

**Sherkan:** Chimera magic.

**Oswin:** Exactly.

---

### **Dark Humor, Because Of Course**

**Glymbar:** (picks a berry, bites it, immediately spits it out) By the ancestors! That tastes like regret!

**Durrandir:** Try not to eat the cursed wilderness next time.

**Glymbar:** I was hungry.

**Sherkan:** If your beard falls off, I’m not helping.

---

### **Moving Onward – Tension Rises**

**SL:** The land shifts as you move. Hills give way to jagged stone and fractured cliff walls. A canyon yawns open, dotted with countless dark holes.

**Durrandir:** This is perfect for an ambush. Stay sharp. Move carefully. Eyes everywhere.

**Sherkan:** Or just let them try something. Saves us the trouble of looking.

**Oswin:** The ley-line cuts straight through the rock here. It’s not just changing the plants anymore. The stone itself feels… wrong.

**Durrandir:** Then we stay close, but not too close.

---

### **The First Real Threat Appears**

**SL:** You round a bend. A piercing screech tears through the canyon air—part bird, part beast, part something that should never exist.

**Durrandir:** Down! Get to cover!

**Oswin:** That is not a normal bird.

**Sherkan:** Sounds angry.

**Glymbar:** Sounds like fun.

**Durrandir:** And how exactly do you plan to axe something that flies?

**Glymbar:** I’ll improvise.

**Sherkan:** He usually does.

---

### **Charging Ahead**

**SL:** The sound echoes closer. Sherkan and Glymbar surge forward, momentum spell fueling their speed. Dust kicks beneath their boots. Oswin follows at a safer pace. Durrandir remains cautious, eyes scanning not just forward… but behind.

**Durrandir:** This could be bait. Don’t get tunnel vision.

**Oswin:** Then keep up. I’m not dying alone.

---

### **The Reveal**

**SL:** The canyon widens into a stone hollow. At its center stands an ancient altar, blackened and burning. A wild man in tattered yellow-red robes screams curses at the sky, shaking his fists.

Above him circles a monster.

A massive geier’s head and wings.
A lion’s muscled body.
Fire spilling from its beak like laughing flame.

It swoops low, taunting him. Burning the offerings. Mocking him.

**Sherkan:** Finally.

**Glymbar:** Called it.

**Oswin:** This isn’t random cruelty. It’s enjoying this.

**Durrandir:** Then let’s end the joke.
