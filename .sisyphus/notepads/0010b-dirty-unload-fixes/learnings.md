- 2026-02-28: BackupScheduler false-dirty fixes require seeding both `lastSeenGlobalFingerprint` and `lastBackedUpGlobalFingerprint` at `start()`, tracking an internal `wasEnabled` transition flag for disabled->enabled re-seeding, and guarding `beforeunload` dirty-flag writes behind `backupConfig.enabled` plus `!isPersistenceSuppressed()`.

- 2026-02-28 (task-2): Bug B fix pattern — `useRef(false)` guard (`hasCheckedRef`) at the top of a one-shot useEffect prevents re-execution after the effect has already run. The biome-ignore comment for `useExhaustiveDependencies` must go on the line *directly before* the `useEffect(` declaration (not inside the effect body) for the suppression to take effect. Bug D fix pattern — call `clearDirtyUnloadFlag()` immediately after `setBackupState({ status: "enabled" })` in both provider paths of handleEnable, and after `suppressPersistence()` in restoreSnapshot before the session reload.
